/**
 * Author : Fulup Ar Foll (jan-2015)
 * Project: Laravel5/OidConnect
 * Object : SocialUser returned IDP authentication profile to the application.
 *          The class is design to be serialize and store in session context.
 *          It uses a facade to restore provider Driver handler from IoC.
 *
 * Note:   SocialUser can return both federated and unfederated users. At
 *         1st visit enduser is not federated and SocialUser will hold UserProfile
 *         as returned from the IDP, with no fedkeys. At second visit, SocialUser holds
 *         a LocalID pointing on users Local DataBase. SocialUser also holds some helpers.
 *         A pointer to the IDP driver, OAuthTokens in case the application would
 *         like to request more OAuth IDP's API and drivername for object restauration
 *         after serialisation.
 *
